    "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. At a fundamental level, Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. Here's a breakdown of how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-Value Pairs: The core idea is that every piece of data (value) is associated with a unique identifier (key).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys: Must be immutable (hashable) objects like strings, numbers, or tuples. This is because keys are used to compute a hash value, which must remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: Can be any Python object (mutable or immutable), including other dictionaries, lists, functions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing: When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python first calculates a hash value for the key using a hash function. This hash value is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash value is then used to determine an index or memory location (a \"bucket\") where the key-value pair will be stored in an underlying array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision Handling: It's possible for two different keys to produce the same hash value (a \"hash collision\"). Dictionaries handle collisions efficiently, typically using techniques like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Addressing: If the calculated index is already occupied, the dictionary probes for the next available slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining: Each bucket might store a list (or similar structure) of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage: The key-value pairs are stored in these buckets. When you access a value using a key, the process is reversed:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash value of the provided key is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hash value leads directly to the specific bucket where the key-value pair is expected to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the bucket, Python compares the provided key with the stored key(s) to find the exact match and retrieve its corresponding value. This makes dictionary lookups extremely fast, ideally O(1) on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Resizing: Dictionaries are dynamic; they can grow and shrink. If the dictionary becomes too full (exceeds a certain load factor), it will automatically resize by creating a larger hash table and re-hashing all existing key-value pairs into the new table. This ensures that lookups remain efficient even as the dictionary expands.\n"

    "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Strings are immutable in Python, meaning their content cannot be changed after they are created. This design choice provides several benefits related to performance, memory, and thread safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for Immutability\n",
    "Performance and Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "String Interning: Python often \"interns\" strings, especially short, frequently used ones. This means that if multiple variables hold the same string literal (e.g., s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"hello\"), they might actually point to the exact same object in memory. If strings were mutable, changing s1 would unexpectedly change s2, leading to unpredictable behavior. Immutability allows this optimization, saving memory and speeding up string comparisons (as Python can just compare memory addresses). 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing: Strings are frequently used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets. For these data structures to work efficiently (using hash tables), their keys/elements must be hashable. Hashable objects must have a hash value that never changes during their lifetime. Since strings are immutable, their hash value is computed once at creation and remains constant, making them reliable for hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you \"modify\" a string (e.g., s = s + \"world\"), Python doesn't change the existing string object. Instead, it creates a new string object in memory with the combined content. While this might seem less efficient at first glance, for many string operations, it can be optimized by the interpreter. The old string object is then marked for garbage collection if no other references point to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thread Safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi-threaded applications, if multiple threads are reading and writing to the same mutable string, it could lead to race conditions and data corruption. Since strings are immutable, multiple threads can safely read and access the same string object concurrently without any risk of one thread altering the string while another is using it. This simplifies concurrent programming as no explicit locking mechanisms are needed for string data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security and Predictability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability ensures that a string's value remains constant once assigned. This predictability helps prevent unintended side effects in functions or parts of the code that might receive a string argument and otherwise accidentally modify it. It makes code easier to reason about and debug. "

    "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple after it has been created. Tuples are immutable data types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Why You Can't Modify Tuple Elements\n",
    "The immutability of tuples is a core design choice in Python, and it means that once a tuple object is instantiated in memory with its elements, its contents are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Memory Allocation: When a tuple is created, Python typically allocates a fixed block of memory for it to store its elements. Since the size and content of a tuple are not meant to change, this fixed allocation is efficient. Allowing modification would require dynamic resizing, which would be less efficient and complex to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing and Dictionary Keys: Tuples are \"hashable,\" meaning they can be assigned a fixed hash value. This property is crucial for using tuples as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets. If a tuple's elements could be modified, its hash value could change, which would break the integrity of hash-based data structures (dictionaries and sets) by making it impossible to reliably find or manage the tuple within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity and Predictability: Immutability ensures that the data within a tuple remains constant. This provides a guarantee that once a tuple is passed around in your program (e.g., to different functions), its values will not be unexpectedly altered by another part of the code. This makes programs more predictable, easier to reason about, and less prone to certain types of bugs, especially in concurrent or multi-threaded environments where multiple parts of a program might access the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to modify a tuple will result in a TypeError:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10 # This line would raise a TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "If you need a collection of items that can be modified, a list is the appropriate data structure to use. If you want a tuple with different elements, you'd have to create a new tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "original_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# Create a new tuple with the desired change\n",
    "new_tuple = (10,) + original_tuple[1:]\n",
    "print(new_tuple) # Output: (10, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(original_tuple) # Output: (1, 2, 3) - The original tuple is unchanged\n",
    "It's important to note, however, that while the tuple itself is immutable, if a tuple contains mutable objects (like lists), the contents of those mutable objects can still be changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "mutable_in_tuple = (1, [2, 3], 4)\n",
    "mutable_in_tuple[1].append(5) # This modifies the list object referenced by the tuple\n",
