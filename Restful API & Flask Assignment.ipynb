    "#3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. Unlike larger, more opinionated frameworks like Django, Flask is a \"microframework\" because it starts with a simple core and lets developers add extensions and libraries as needed. It doesn't force you to use a specific database or a particular project structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask's design makes it an excellent choice for building APIs for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity and Minimalism: Flask is easy to learn and use. It has a small code base and a clear, explicit structure, which means developers can get a simple API up and running with just a few lines of code. This is perfect for quick prototyping or building small-to-medium-sized services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Freedom: Flask doesn't make many decisions for you. This allows you to choose your own tools for things like database management, form validation, and security. For building an API, you can easily integrate popular libraries for data serialization (like JSONify) and handling API requests, allowing for a custom-tailored solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Web Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, which makes it easy to test your API without needing to set up a separate web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask has a vast ecosystem of extensions that add functionality. For APIs, extensions like Flask-RESTful or Flask-RESTX can simplify the process of building RESTful endpoints by providing tools for parsing requests, formatting responses, and generating documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for Microservices: Because of its minimal nature, Flask is often used to build microservices, which are small, independent services that perform a single function. This architecture is common in modern applications, and Flask's lightweight design fits it perfectly."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Manage Database Sessions: It provides a pre-configured database session (db.session) that is automatically managed for you. This session is tied to the request-response cycle, so you don't have to worry about creating and closing sessions manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide an ORM: It allows you to use SQLAlchemy's powerful Object-Relational Mapper to interact with your database using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL. For example, instead of writing a SELECT statement, you can simply use User.query.all().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Migrations: While not directly part of the core library, it works seamlessly with Flask-Migrate, which is a wrapper for Alembic. This combination helps manage database schema changes (migrations) as your application evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread Safety: It ensures that each web request has its own session, preventing issues with data concurrency in multi-threaded environments. This is crucial for web applications.\n",

    "#12. How do you define a custom Jinja filter in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a custom Jinja filter in Flask by either registering it with the main application instance or by using a blueprint's app_template_filter decorator. This allows you to create reusable functions that modify data directly within your HTML templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Registering with the Flask Application \n",
